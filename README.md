# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

## Topics Covered

- Git commit
- Git branch
- Git merge

## Challenges Faced

None so far.

## Conclusion

I refreshed my knowledge about basic git, including comming, branching, and merging. I also learned new knowledge, e.g. `git pull` includes `git fetch` and `git merge`, creating git branch using `git branch` (usually I use `git checkout -b`).

## Git Branch

Git branch is a feature in Git that allows developers to create multiple versions of their codebase, called branches, which can be worked on independently of each other. Branches are useful for managing different versions of a project, testing new features, and collaborating with other developers. Each branch has its own commit history, allowing developers to experiment with new ideas without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main codebase when the changes are ready to be incorporated.
